If it was not for all the men in the factory that had no idea of the pending disaster Mwangi Kamau would not have made the effort to run the 3km stretch like his life depended on it. His legs were screaming at him to stop but he just had to continue, his sense of duty couldn't allow him to not put his all. "Let me die trying than not try" he thought to himself. 

When he got to the factory he was breathing like a mad bull, sweating like he had just stepped out of a shower totally out of breath. No energy to lift a finger, he had collapsed by the gate house

It took him a minute or two to realize he was still alive, his heart was still beating hard...
