The men had surrounded the building by now, weapons had long been drawn and 
determination was written on there faces, it was now or never.

"don't come any closer" shouted don carlos and raised his sawn off handgun. Pointing it 
directly at Juan baptist

"I said don't come any closer, you think am joking" he said and let off a shot aimed at baptist's feet.

"Next shot through your balls"
looking around he waved the gun towards the other 5 men.
"You have no business here and you better leave before I make your wifes widows, you hear me" he shouted.

Juan baptist took some steps back, raised his hands and with contempt in his voice he said
"This is not the end of this, we cannot go on like this Don carlos"
why do you protect that evil man, he has not brought any good to the community or to us"
